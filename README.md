# thrive
A dynamic, front-end prototype for Aura by Thrive, a conceptual application designed to reinvent workplace productivity and well-being. This project visualizes the main user dashboard, focusing on a calm, intuitive interface that helps users manage their energy and attention, not just their tasks.
This prototype was built to bring the idea to life, featuring a vibrant "Aurora" theme and interactive elements.
